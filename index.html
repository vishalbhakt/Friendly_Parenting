                    <li>Seeing through child’s eyes, A coach makes the client look at an issue through the child
                        perspective. This broadens a parent’s horizon and helps them understand the needs of a growing
                        child. Sometimes it’s a parent who needs adjust as per the child, not the other way round.</li>

                        their children that include active listening and empathetic speaking to make your child feel
                        important. It is also crucial for a parent to not to react but thoughtfully respond to a given
                        situation, it’s good communication that strengthens the bond of a family.</li>
                    <li>Check quality behaviour, many times, a parent witnesses, a child display unwanted traits such as
                        bowling, lying or throwing tantrums. A parent may act a bit too harshly with their child making

                <p>With years of experience helping individuals unlock their true potential, I’m here to guide you
                    through the essentials of interview preparation. Follow these golden rules to ensure you present
                    yourself as the confident, competent candidate you are.</p>
                <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Preparation is Key: Unlocking Your Potential</h2>
                <p>We'll work together to ensure you're fully prepared for interview day. Here's what we'll cover:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Documentation Done Right:</b> Resumes, cover letters, references – we'll make sure your
                        documents are polished and highlight your skills and experience in a way that grabs attention.
                        Before stepping into the interview room, ensure that all your documents are in order. Having
                        these documents ready and organized demonstrates your attention to detail and preparedness.</li>
                    <li><b>Dress to Impress:</b> Your attire can significantly impact the impression you make.
                        Dressing appropriately shows respect for the interviewer and the company. We'll discuss
                        interview attire that makes you look confident and professional, reflecting the company culture.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Wait to Create Your First Impression:</b> From the moment you walk in, first impressions are
                        crucial and are often formed within the first few seconds of meeting someone. We'll practice
                        greetings, body language, and professional communication to make a positive impact.</li>
                    <li><b>The Power of Communication:</b> Effective communication is key to acing your interview. It’s
                        not
                        just about what you say, but how you say it with <b>Clarity and Conciseness.</b> Listen
                        carefully to
                        the interviewer’s questions and respond thoughtfully. <b>Non-Verbal Cues:</b> Maintain eye
                        contact, use
                        appropriate facial expressions, and avoid fidgeting.</li>
                    <li><b>Practice Makes Perfect:</b> Mock interviews are your secret weapon. We'll conduct practice
                        sessions
                        tailored to specific positions, helping you anticipate questions, articulate your responses
                        effectively, and manage interview anxiety.</li>
