                <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Parenting Coaching</h1>
                <p>Parent coaching involves a strengths-based approach to teaching parenting, giving clear, explicit
                    directives to parents, and caregiver, and designed to improve challenging behaviours in children and
                    youth.
                    Parent coaching is focused on why the child is behaving this way in the present moment, and what
                    current specific actions are needed by the caregiver/parent to alter in order to Nourish the child’s
                    behavioural response.
                    The parenting coach is a trained professional who helps the clients face their parenting challenges
                    by providing guidance, tools and strategies. Coaching for parents greatly benefits, clients who want
                    to overcome their weaknesses and become the parents they aspire to be. A coach aims to make the
                    clients capable of handling their parenting issues as well as achieve their parenting goals
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sort you out: -before helping a child, it’s important for a parent to become one’s ideal Self.
                        This helps parents become more fulfilled and make their parenting more effective.</li>
                    <li>Help a child cope up: - It enables a parent to help their children, manage social and academic
                        pressures, by providing the necessary tools for a child’s mental & emotional well-being that
                        prepares a parent to help a child deal with frustration, peer pressure or sibling rivalry.</li>
                    <li>Seeing through child’s eyes, A coach makes the client look at an issue through the child
                        perspective. This broadens a parent’s horizon and helps them understand the needs of a growing
                        child. Sometimes it’s a parent who needs adjust as per the child, not the other way round.</li>
                    <li>Improving the connection: -Coaching can greatly help a client build effective communication with
                        their children that include active listening and empathetic speaking to make your child feel
                        important. It is also crucial for a parent to not to react but thoughtfully respond to a given
                        situation, it’s good communication that strengthens the bond of a family.</li>
                    <li>Check quality behaviour, many times, a parent witnesses, a child display unwanted traits such as
                        bowling, lying or throwing tantrums. A parent may act a bit too harshly with their child making
                        the matter worse (spanking, screaming, grounding). Parenting coach can provide with suitable
                        strategies to correct these behavioural issues. The coach can also help a client counsel a child
                        during these difficult phases.</li>
