                <h2>1. Sort You Out</h2>
                <p>
                    Before helping a child, it’s important for a parent to become one’s ideal self. This helps parents
                    become more fulfilled and make their parenting more effective.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Help a Child Cope Up</h2>
                <p>
                    It enables a parent to help their children manage social and academic pressures by providing tools
                    for mental & emotional well-being to deal with frustration, peer pressure, or sibling rivalry.
                </p>

            <div class="benefit" id="benefit-3">
                <h2>3. Seeing Through Child’s Eyes</h2>
                <p>
                    A coach makes the client look at an issue through the child’s perspective. This broadens a parent’s
                    horizon and helps them understand the needs of a growing child. Sometimes it’s a parent who needs to
                    adjust as per the child.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Improving the Connection</h2>
                <p>
                    Coaching helps build effective communication with children that include active listening and
                    empathetic speaking. It strengthens the family bond through thoughtful responses.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Check Quality Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    A parenting coach provides suitable strategies to correct unwanted behavioral traits like bullying,
                    lying, or tantrums. They guide clients to counsel their children during difficult phases.
